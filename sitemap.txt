A UK court has ordered Julian Assange's extradition to the United States on espionage charges.

A London court has formally issued an order to extradite Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to the United States. That puts Assange's fate in the hands of UK home secretary Priti Patel, who will decide whether to extradite him to the United States, where he faces espionage charges. Wikileaks made headlines in 2010 when it released thousands of classified documents and diplomatic cables sent to the US State Department. Assange is wanted in the United States on 18 criminal charges related to the leaks, and if convicted, he could face up to 175 years in prison.

In 2012, Assange sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remained for years until his asylum was revoked in 2019. Wikileaks claimed at the time that the embassy spied on it and took photos, videos, and audio recordings of its founder. He was detained at the embassy, and the US government has been attempting to extradite him ever since.

A British court ruled in January 2021 that he should not be extradited to the United States to face trial because "the risk to his mental and physical wellbeing was too great." The US government, on the other hand, filed an appeal, claiming that he had no history of "serious and enduring mental illness." In December 2021, a UK appeals court overturned the previous ruling, paving the way for his extradition.

Assange participated in the latest trial via video call from Belmarsh Prison in London. The chief magistrate, Paul Goldspring, issued the extradition order, saying during the trial, "I am duty bound to send your case to the secretary of state for a decision." According to The Guardian, Assange's team will have the opportunity to sway Patel's decision by sending "serious submissions" to the home secretary, as well as challenge issues he lost in court but hasn't yet appealed. And it is possible to persuade a home secretary to block extraditions â€” former UK home secretary Theresa May refused to extradite Scottish hacker Gary McKinnon on human rights grounds. When he appealed his extradition orders, British activist Lauri Love was able to persuade the UK High Court to side with him.
