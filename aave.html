Aave – Bitcoin & Crypto Trading Blog

Aave is an open-source decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that allows customers to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies at variable or fixed interest rates. Lenders earn interest by depositing cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools, whereas debtors can use their crypto as collateral to obtain loans through these pools. The protocol algorithmically determines the rates of interest for debtors and lenders based on the funds available in the pools. Aave also provides access to flash loans, which are designed to be integrated into other businesses.

Aave was initially based entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, but the challenge is now considered a multichain platform. Aave is integrated with Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Concord, in addition to Ethereum.

AAVE is the local token for Aave. It is an ERC-20 token used primarily for governance.

At the time of writing, Aave has one of the best total value locked (TVL) among DeFi platforms. According to DeFi Pulse, the platform's TVL is currently greater than $11 billion.

A Temporary Aave's origins can be traced back to 2017, when Finnish programmer Stani Kulechov and his team created ETHLend. ETHLend's concept was to allow customers to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies from one another by posting mortgage requests and gives on the platform. ETHLend was the first DeFi protocol to provide peer-to-peer lending.

ETHLend held a preliminary coin offering (ICO) in November 2017 for $16.2 million. Throughout this period, the challenge purchased 1 billion native LEND tokens. However, as the cryptocurrency market entered bear market conditions in 2018, the challenge faced a lack of liquidity, as well as issues matching mortgage requests and gives. ETHLend was rebranded to Aave in September 2018, which means "ghost" in Finnish.

The Aave V1 mainnet was launched on the Ethereum blockchain on January 8, 2020. It launched the primary Ethereum market with traditional ERC-20 tokens, as well as the Uniswap market, where customers could use Uniswap V1 liquidity pool tokens as collateral. The migration from the LEND token to the AAVE token occurred in October 2020 at a 100:1 ratio.

The Aave V2 mainnet will go live in December 2020. The most recent model added risk management tools and reduced transaction costs. Aave has also started supporting the Polygon market on the Polygon sidechain.

Aave launched permissioned lending and a liquidity service known as Aave Arc for institutional traders in January 2022. Aave V3 protocol will be deployed in March 2022.

How Does Aave Function?
Mechanism of Lending/Borrowing
On the Aave platform, there are two types of market contributors: lenders and debtors.

Lenders are customers who deposit assets into Aave and receive "aTokens" in a 1:1 ratio to the asset deposited. The aToken is an interest-bearing token that is pegged to the underlying asset's value, so lenders can redeem the aToken 1:1 for the unique asset they deposited. The lender's aTokens stability grows, reflecting the interest paid by the asset's debtors. Lenders are also paid interest on flash loans.

Debtors deposit items into Aave to be used as collateral, but they will only borrow a portion of the value of the deposited collateral. This is due to the "overcollateral" concept, which allows Aave to remain solvent. The Mortgage-To-Worth (LTV) ratio determines the borrowing power of the collateral. This is determined by the volatility of the collateral asset as well as the opposite risk parameters.

For example, if the LTV for borrowing LINK is 80%, the most a person can borrow is an amount equal to 0.8 LINK for every 1 LINK in collateral. The mortgage/worth of the collateral ratio is calculated and expressed as a proportion for each type of collateral.

Debtors who want to pay off their debts should return the borrowed items plus interest. The collateral value is locked within the protocol as long as there is debt.

One of Aave's unique features is the ability for debtors to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. In general, interest rates in DeFi are volatile, making it difficult to predict the long-term cost of borrowing. Customers can, however, switch the speed with Aave in order to lower borrowing costs. When debtors expect interest rates to rise, they typically switch from a floating rate to a fixed rate, and vice versa. However, if the lender's earnings price for the asset rises above the fixed borrow price, the fixed price may be rebalanced to the "new fixed rate."

Threat Mitigation and Liquidation
The liquidation mechanism is based on what is known as a "well-being issue" (HF). It expresses the protection of the borrower's belongings as well as the underlying value of the borrowed asset. The higher the health issue, the safer the asset. If the health-care crisis worsens, the likelihood of liquidation decreases. In the event of a sharp drop in the indicator, the person can completely or partially repay the mortgage or deposit additional collateral. When HF falls below a certain level, the mortgage is liquidated.

It is possible to liquidate no more than 50% of the person's belongings. The primary advantage of this method is that customers can keep a portion of the mortgage and wait for the value of collateral to rise. However, if the value of the collateral continues to fall, the likelihood of losing the remaining 50% increases. Chainlink oracles provide value knowledge for Aave loans.

If the liquidation procedure is not followed, loans may become undercollateralized, resulting in problematic debts. In such cases, the Aave protocol may employ a risk-mitigation mechanism known as the Security Module. It includes a fund for insurance coverage in case of a shortfall.

In the event of a shortfall, the funds required to refinance the deficit may be auctioned off to the Backstop Module. Customers can deposit stablecoins or ETH to the Backstop Module before selling in open markets. Customers in extreme conditions could vote for a Restoration Issuance of AAVE tokens to be auctioned to the Backstop Module first, followed by open markets.

Loans on the Spot
Flash loans are uncollateralized loans in which compensation is distributed across the same block. In general, they are used for arbitrage, collateral swap, collateral refinancing, and portfolio rebalancing. The Flash loan has a 0.09 percent fee deducted from the borrowed amount. The fees are paid to lenders.

Options for Aave V2
According to the Aave website, the market cap of Aave V1 is currently around $100 million, while the market cap of Ethereum V2 is $15 billion. The primary reason for this distinction is that the V2 protocol makes more efficient use of gasoline. Customers can save up to 50% on commissions in certain situations.

Aave also contributes to the V2 protocol:

Customers can transfer their collateral from one token to another via collateral swap. It may help to halt liquidation in specific markets.
Debt tokenization is the process by which debtors obtain tokens that represent their debt. It enables debtors to delegate local credit score.
Batch flash loans — With flash loans, customers can borrow multiple items at the same time.
Options for Aave V3
Aave V3 was released in March 2022, so customers have only recently discovered the benefits of the new model. Aave V3 markets currently have a combined market value of more than $50 million. This efficiency does not include the Ethereum market, which must be implemented when the community determines the maturity of the V3 markets.

Aave V3 also included the following enhancements to risk management and fuel optimization by 20-25 percent:

Portal — allows liquidity to flow between V3 markets across completely different networks.
Remoted mode — In Aave V3, belongings may be listed as remoted. Debtors who provide a distant asset as collateral are not permitted to provide different belongings as collateral.
When the value of provided and borrowed assets is correlated, the effectivity mode allows debtors to increase borrowing power.
Several incentives — allows listed belongings to allow additional incentives
Native Token Aave
AAVE is an ERC-20 token that is specific to the Aave platform. Following the 100:1 conversion from LEND to AAVE, 13 million AAVE tokens have been redeemed by LEND holders. The remaining three million AAVE provide, out of the total 16 million, are distributed to the AAVE Ecosystem Reserve. It implies that all AAVE tokens have already been launched with a token allocation ratio of 81 percent to 19 percent.

AAVE is the central component of the Aave ecosystem, which is known as Aavenomics. At the moment, AAVE can be used for:

Investing in the Security Module
Customers stake AAVE tokens within the Security Module in exchange for Stake AAVE (StkAAVE) tokens. When customers withdraw tokens from the stake, Aave is returned to them and StkAAVE is burned by the platform. To make up for shortfalls, up to 30% of StkAAVE can be used. Every day, 550 StkAAVE are distributed to all customers who stake AAVE in the Security Module as a reward.

Incentives for the Environment and Security
Security Incentives ensure protocol security by incentivizing AAVE holders to participate in the Security Module. To maintain the sustainability of liquidity pools, ecosystem incentives are offered to liquidity suppliers and liquidators. Holders of AAVEs decide how the Ecosystem Reserve should be divided between security and ecosystem incentives.

Governance
AAVE tokens are used to vote on AAVE Improvement Proposals (AIPs). Customers must first create a request for comment (ARC) and share it with the neighborhood in order to submit governance proposals. This method is used to ensure in-depth discussion before AIPs are pushed for on-chain voting. If ARC receives assistance from the community, it transforms into AIP. To date, at least 36 ARCs have been converted into AIPs.
